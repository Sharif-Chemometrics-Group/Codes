***Hyperspectral Image (HSI) Classification with 2D-CNNs and Model Interpretability***


A comprehensive Jupyter Notebook pipeline for the classification of Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) data. The workflow starts with a graphical tool for ROI selection, proceeds to training an efficient 2D-CNN, and concludes with advanced model interpretation techniques to understand the model's decision-making process at both the feature and spectral band levels.
